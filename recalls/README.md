> **Powerful recursive method call analysis and symbol navigation for VS Code**

Recalls is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides comprehensive method call analysis, symbol caching, and recursive call tracking across your entire workspace. Whether you're debugging complex codebases, understanding method relationships, or performing code analysis, Recalls gives you the tools to navigate and understand your code structure efficiently.

## üöÄ Features

### üìä **Comprehensive Method Analysis**

## üì¶ Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Recalls"
4. Click Install

**Or install from VSIX:**
```bash
code --install-extension recalls-0.0.1.vsix
```

## üéÆ Usage

### **Getting Started**

1. **Open a Project**: Open any project with supported file types
2. **Wait for Indexing**: The extension automatically indexes your workspace symbols
3. **Explore Views**: Use the "Recursive Search" activity bar to access the three main views

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

- `Ctrl+Alt+A` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Alt+A` (Mac): Analyze method calls at cursor
- `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Alt+I` (Mac): Analyze internal method calls at cursor
- `Ctrl+Shift+F`: Search symbols in current file

### **Right-Click Actions**

- **On any method/function**: "Analyze Method Calls" or "Analyze Internal Method Calls"
- **On method call results**: "Go to Method Call" or "Go to Internal Call"

### **Command Palette Commands**

- `Recalls: Analyze Method Calls` - Analyze what calls TO a method
- `Recalls: Analyze Internal Calls` - Analyze what calls FROM within a method  
- `Recalls: Set Analysis Depth` - Configure recursion depth (1-10)
- `Recalls: Show Cache Statistics` - View cache performance metrics
- `Recalls: Re-index Workspace` - Force rebuild of symbol cache
- `Recalls: Clear Analysis` - Clear all analysis results

## üéõÔ∏è **Configuration & Settings**

### **Analysis Depth**
Control how deep the recursive analysis goes:
- **Depth 1**: Direct calls only
- **Depth 3**: Default, good balance of performance and coverage
- **Depth 10**: Maximum depth, comprehensive but slower

### **File Filtering**
The extension automatically excludes:
- `node_modules/` directories
- `bin/` and `obj/` build output folders
- Files ignored by `.gitignore` patterns (configurable)

### **Supported File Types**
- **TypeScript**: `.ts`, `.tsx`
- **JavaScript**: `.js`, `.jsx`  
- **C#**: `.cs`
- **Python**: `.py`
- **Java**: `.java`
- **C/C++**: `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`
- **And more**: `.php`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.kt`, `.swift`, `.dart`

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Components**

- **Symbol Cache Manager**: High-performance caching system for workspace symbols
- **Method Analysis Service**: Recursive method call analysis engine
- **Internal Analysis Service**: Method body parsing and internal call detection

- Check cache statistics for debugging info

### **Slow Performance**
- Reduce analysis depth for large codebases
- Exclude additional directories if needed
- Check cache hit rates in statistics
